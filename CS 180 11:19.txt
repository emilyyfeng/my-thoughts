RECURSION — a self reference with 2 properties:
1) a base case/cases — terminating condition that does not use recursion to produce an answer
2) a set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the case base

In programming:
- methods can call itself (e.g. Fibonacci)
- data structures can reference itself e.g:
private class Node {
	String value;
	Node next;
}
