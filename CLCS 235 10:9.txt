IO:
- affair with Zeus => turns her into a cow to trick Hera
- given as a gift to Hera by Zeus
- guarded by Argus (many-eyed one)
- Hermes (sent by Zeus) to kill Argus — lulls Argus to sleep by telling stories & playing lyre
- Hera sends gadfly to chase Io (to Aeschylus, gadfly/"oistros" is spirit of Argus)
- name Io = cry of pain (equivalent of "ah")

- chorus describes Io's story: "a fight that can't be fought, a way with no way out"

What makes Aeschylus' different?
- no other version where Prometheus and Io meet
- Io is the daughter of Inachus (a river god, son of Oceanus) — makes her a relative to Oceanids

PROMETHEUS' PROPHECY
- agrees to reveal to Io what lies ahead for her, warns that it will "break her heart"
	- BAD: her "wandering will last for generations"
	- GOOD: she will have a lineage of heroes after settling in Egypt (13 generations from Io) Heracles will free him 

Io: "what good is living? Why not throw myself from this rock now?"
- forknowledge/hope can help endure suffering
- others who suffer can help with suffering

HERMES: FOIL TO PROMETHEUS
A battle of wits: Hermes (man of the moment "kairos") vs. Prometheus (master of the long game)
- Prometheus: "Time, as it grows old, teaches all things"
- then Hermes tries to win over Oceanids: they say "we will bear with him whatever fate Zeus sends" 
	- rare moment in a Greek tragedy's chorus actively defies a god
	- ancient scholia (multiple scholars' notes) were scandalized
- Hermes threatens: Zeus will attack with lightning, then throw him into Tartarus, will only bring him up to let the eagle eat his liver — Prometheus refuses to tell his secret

GRAND ENDING
- heavens open up
- Prometheus (and according to some versions, the Oceanids) descend into the earth
- cliffhanger

PROMETHEUS UNBOUND (sequel)
- titans realsed
- Heracles kills eagle, Prometheus freed
- Reconciliation with Zeus 

BIG CONCEPT: "BAGGAGE"
- we all approach the reading of texts with the baggage of our values and our experience


INTERPRETATIONS WITH BAGGAGE:

LATE ANTIQUITY (Christian approach)
- Prometheus dangerously Adam-like (creator of humans) and Christ-life (sacrificer for humankind: similar torture)
- heavy allegories (eagle represents worldly cares, fire is God's providence)

MIDDLE AGES
- emphasize his role as craftsman rather than a creator demigod
- fire = clarity of divine truth, punishment = voluntary solitude and brooding, eagle = mental turmoil of a contemplative life
- no sympathetic views of Prometheus, sometimes even hostile

RENAISSANCE
- Prometheus is archetypal artist and innovator
- more sympathetic, still through Christian lens
- fire = spark of life, eagle = suffering of an artist
- punishment becomes lesson: great creativity often entails great suffering

ENGLIGHTENENT
- Prometheus becomes a cultural hero, symbol of reason and intellect
- fire = reason/intellect, eagle = tyranny (Aeschylus becomes popular again)
- Prometheus = champion against tyranny (referenced in French Revolution, Napoleon, Benjamin Franklin)
- Voltaire's poem "Pandora": Prometheus creates Pandora, steals fire to animate her, marries her, births mankind with her, but Pandora has affairs, which explains the diversity of humans

ROMANTICS
- Goethe, Byron, and more
- Percy Shelley: wrote Prometheus Unbound (French/American slogan "liberty, equality, fraternity" — Demogorgon "violent spirit of the people" takes down Zeus/tyrant instead of his son with Thetis), "Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world"
- Mary Shelley: "Prometheus: The Modern Prometheus"
	- "spark of being" is Renaissance "baggage"
	- undermines Romantic Prometheus myth: presents the idea of "if it CAN be done by humans, it MUST be done by humans" as dangerous

INDUSTRIAL ERA
- Karl Marx: wrote dissertation on Epicurus (Greek philosopher), in his foreword said "Prometheus is the most eminent saint and martyr in the philosophical calendar"
- Electricity invented — Edison "at least imprisoned Prometheus' spark in a glass globe" (London Newspaper)

MODERN ERA
- in the wake of Mary Shelley (Metropolis, Brave New World, Blade Runner, Prometheus)
- Robert Oppenheimer called "the Prometheus of the Age"
- Silicon Valley's current "Prometheus-complex" (Zuckerberg's Prometheus AI)
