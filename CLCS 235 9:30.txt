PROMETHEUS:
Sources:
- Hesiod: Theogony, Works & Days (order, aetiologies)
- Aeschylus: Prometheus Bound (tyranny vs. intellect)
- Plato: Protagoras (allegory of techne (arts/crafts/skills) & civic virtue)
- Later Greek mythography; Apollodorus, Ovid (Roman)

"Prometheus" = "forethought" or "forethinker"
- pro "before" + meth "thought"
Brother Epimetheus = "afterthought"

Origina
- born from Titan Iapetus & Oceanid nymph Clymene (or Asia in some sources)
- sided with Zeus/refrained from opposing him during Titanomachy

Sacrifice invented: Mecone (current name is Sikyon) "cut"
- Gave Zeus two portions of ox: tasty meat hidden, bones dressed with fat
- Zeus picked fat-covered bones — in Hesiod's version, Zeus knowingly went with Prometheus' trick
- Aetiology for Greek sacrifice of trimming fat off meat, taking bones, and burned those for the gods (called "knise"), leaving meat for the men to eat

- Zeus still gets mad, ironically takes away human knowledge of how to make fire
- Prometheus steals a live ember in a "narthex" (giant fennel) for humans, fire => tecne

Associated with:
- housing, agriculture, astronomy/calendrics
- numbers and letters
- animal domestication, seamanship
- medicine, mining, metallurgy

Rituals associated with Prometheus:
- Athenian "Prometheia" festival — torch relay race modeled on the theft

Pandora:
- crafted by the gods
- Hephaestus molds, Athena dresses/teaches, Aphrodite charms, Hemes wires the mind
- Pandora = "all gift"
- Sent to Epimetheus despite warnings from Prometheus
- Opens a pithos (jar), unleashes human woes, but hope/expectation (elpis) remains under the lid after she closes — blessing held back, or a curse?

Prometheus' punishment
- Kratos (manifestation of might) & Bia (violent force) seize Prometheus
- Hephaestus forges chains
- Daily, eagle rips out and eats liver, nightly, liver regrowth
- Bound arms, raptor poised, exposed torso in representations
- Paired with Atlas in vase sets

In Aeschylus' versionL
- Prometheus is more a political prisoner
- he has a secret that Zeus fears: if Zeus weds Thetis, her son will overthrow him
- on Heracles' travels, kills eagle (becomes constellation Aquila) with arrow (bcomes constellation Sagitta) & breaks chains (with Zeus' consent bc it gave his son kleos/fame/renown)
- then Prometheus tells Zeus the secret
- Zeus wants to save face — said Prometheus would be bound forever to the Caucasus mountains — gives Prometheus an iron ring set with Caucasian rock instead; aetiology for wearing rings

Deucalion's Flood
- Zeus decides to purge degenerate humans
- Prometheus warns son Deucalion, married to Pyrrha (daughter of Epimetheus & Pandora)
- Deucalion builds ark (meaning cheat), survives 9 days & nights of flooding, lands at Parnassus
- repopulates the earth by throwing stones over shoulders which create new humans
- "laas" (stones) => "laos" (people) pun

Prometheus molded humans out of clay (with Athena's assistance)

PLATO'S PROTAGORAS — argument about whether virtue can be taught
Outline the myth
- gods created life, ordered Prometheus & Epimetheus to prepare them
- Epimetheus distributed attributes like wings, fur, etc., Prometheus would inspect
- When Epimetheus came to human race, he had run out of good traits; Prometheus stole crafts, wisdom, fire from Hephaestus & Athena without Zeus' consent
- Zeus feared entire race of man will be exterminated due to their lack of political knowledge, sent Hermes to impart justice & reverence, asked if he should give them to a few people or to all, Zeus said all
- Zeus makes law "he who has no part of justice or reverence should be put to death because they are a plague on society"

What is the message
- specific knowledge like carpentry should be learned from experts, but political knowledge & virtue should be heard from everyone and everyone has a right to share & hold their opinion

What does Plato add/change
- Prometheus & Epimetheus had to create and fashion life
- Prometheus steals crafts, wisdom, tecne, not just fire
- Stole from Hephaestus & Athena, not Zeus
- Zeus wants the humans to succeed and have order/morals

How does this myth function as a philosophical argument
- conveying messages/morals the way an elder speaks to a younger (like children's books)
- doesn't argue, but insinuates — leaves things up to interpretation

SOCIO-BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS
- core idea: myths reflect evolved human behaviors and survival strategies (e.g. cooperation, kinship loyalty, mate selection, competition, aggression management)
