DIVINE ORIGINS
- Otrera (founder-queen), daughter of Ares
- homelands: Themiscyra (on the Thermodon, most common origin), Lake Maeotis/Sea of Azov, Libyan Amazons in Diodorus (in rare cases)
- alleged city founders: Ephesos (on western coast of Turkey, had ancient wonder of world temple to Artemis), Smyrna, Cyme, Sinope also attributed to Amazons

MATRIARCHAL NATION:
- no men in civic life
- annual reproductive part with Gargareans (male tribe)
- girls trained for war from childhood, various stories of what they did with boys (sent them to Gargareans, exposed in wilderness, or mutilated slaves)
- Ares and Artemis as patron deities

NAME "AMAZON":
- folk etymology: a-mazos => "without breast" — story of cauterized right breast in order to draw bows better BUT no one-breasted Amazons in Greek art
- most likely name of actual group of people that lived in the region

ANIMALS
- Horse culture = nomadic life
Dogs:
- vases often show Amazons with hounds trotting beside them
- one even has a dog with a red collar and a conversation above the Amazons that seems to reference the dog
- Strabo and Herodotus describe steppe hunters whose horses and dogs life motionless until the arrow is shot, then all three sprint after the prey

AMAZONOMACHY 1: HERACLES & HIPPOLYTA'S GIRDLE
- 9th labor of Heracles, task: retrieve Hippolyta's war-belt (gift from Ares, symbol of queenly authority)
- Version 1: peaceful curiousity, Hippolyta offers girdle freely, then Heracles peacefully leaves
- Version 2: Hera disguises herself as an Amazon, spreads rumor that Heracles will abduct Hippolyta and battle ensues

AMAZONOMACHY 2: THESEUS & BATTLE FOR ATHENS
- Theseus joins Heracles' expedition, abducts Hippolyta (named Antiope)
- Amazons invade Attica to get their queen back, Greek sources treat this as a real historical war
- war ends with Amazons defeated and Antiope/Hippolyta dead
- Version 1: Hippolyta fell in love with Theseus and died defending him
- Version 2: she is slain by Theseus because she was angry about Theseus taking another wife and joined a revolt against new wife (Phaedra)
- Later Athenians used the Amazon invasion on the Parthenon metopes as a thinly veiled allegory for the Persian Wars
- The gendered threat (armed women) merges with the ethnic threat (Persians) and the political threat (foreign invaders)

AMAZONOMACHY 3: PENTHESILEA AT TROY
- In the lost epic "Aethiopis", an Amazon Penthesilea comes to Troy to regain honor (dying an noble death in battle) after accidentally killing her sister with a spear, joins Trojans
- Achilles kills her in single combat; some versions add the detail that, as she dies, he falls in love with her beauty
- Thersites mocks Achilles for loving a dead barbarian woman, Achilles kills him in rage and has to be ritually purified

HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF AMAZONS?
In Black Sea and Don-Volga region, about 20% of graves with weapons belong to women
- skeletons have arrowheads still embedded in bones, or axe and sword wounds that match combat trauma,"boxer's fractures" in fists
- one burial: woman with arrowhead lodged in her knee, plus mirror jewelry, spearheads, and two children in the grave

Real Scythian and Sarmatian horse-people wore tunics, trousers, and pointed caps — exactly what we see on later Amazons

IDEOLOGY: AMAZONS AS THE ULTIMATE "OTHER"
Inversion of Greek culture:
- Amazons are public political and martial whereas Greek women are demestic, veiled, and anonymous
- They reject male heirs, whereas Athens obsesses over producing legitimate sons
- The women's patron deities are Ares and Artemis, not Hera and Aphrodite like Greeks

Narrative rule:
- in every major myth, the Amazon queen (Hippolyta, Antiope, Penthesilea) dies
- the defeat restores the "correct" order and reassures the male audience that current social norms are both natural and inevitable

FURTHER "AMAZON"S
- The River: in 1541, Francisco de Orellana sailed down the Amazon, claimed was attacked and defeated by tall, pale women with bows (more likely indigenous male or mixed-gender warrior groups), hence Amazon River
- Queen Elizabeth: seen as unnatural for a woman to be ruling England, frequently compared to Penthesilea and styled herself after her
- Xena the Warrior Princess
- 1941 Wonder Woman

MYTH INTERPRETATION: SEMIOTIC, POST-STRUCTURALIST
Myth is a natural product of language
- every word is a sign made up of: signifier: (the form like the literal word, image, gesture) + signified (the concept or idea it calls to mind)
- OR denotation vs. connotation — myths operate mostly on the connotative level
