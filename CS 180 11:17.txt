Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- data type is defined by its behavior or semantics (as viewed by a user of the data, includes operations and possible values)
- user is unaware of implementation details (cannot make assumptions about implementation)
- implementers of ADTs have great flexibility

2 common ADTs:
1) Stack (LIFO)
- push: add an element to the collection
- pull: remove the most recently added element
Stack uses:
- good for managing storage of local variables, RPN (Reverse Polish/Postfix Notation), tracking changes for undo

2) Queue (FIFO)
- enqueue: add element to the rear terminal position
- dequeue: remove element from the front terminal position
Queue uses:
- Files sent to printer, threads (or processes) waiting for access to CPU (part of OS scheduling)
- network packets waiting for transmission
- producer/consumer relationships (produces generate requests/data and enqueues them, consumers dequeue and process)

Stack interface:
public interface Stack {
	void push(int value;
	int pop();
}

Queue interface:
public interface Queue {
	void add(int value); // add to end
	int remove(); // remove from front
	int peek();
	boolean isEmpty();
}

Generics: allow types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods
- to prevent code re-use, eliminate casts, better type checks at compile time
E.g.:
Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<Integer>();
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();



HASHMAPS
- implements the Map interface, Maps map keys to values
- Hash table-based implementation (NOT thread-safe)
- sometimes called associative array/dictionary

HashMap<K, V>
K: type of the "key"
V: type of the "value"
HashMap<String, Tree> map = new
HashMap<String, Tree>();
map.put(“elm”, new Tree(“elm”, 34.5));
map.put(“maple”, new Tree(“maple”, 14.2));
Tree t = map.get(“elm”);

Performance:
Capacity: number of buckets in the hash table
Load factor: how full the table can get before capacity is increased
- initial capacity and load factor are the two parameters that impact performance (default load factor is 0.75, default initial capacity is 16)
