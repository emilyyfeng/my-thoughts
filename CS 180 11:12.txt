Data structure: A way to organize, store, and retrieve information in a program
Dynamic data structure: A data structure whose memory use can grow and shrink as necessary to store the information being maintained

LinkedList: outer class that implements accessor and mutator methods, similar to ArrayList
- maintains "head pointer" (reference to node)

Node()
- implements individual node
- each node is linked to another (except the last)
- stores relevant data

Forming a linked list:
Growing "backwards" (adding to the beginning)
- use one variable to refer the "head" of the list
- use a temp var to refer to a new Node
- set temp.next = head
- set head = temp
Growing "forward" (adding to the end)
- use one variable to refer to the "head of" the list
- use a second variable to refer to the tail of the list (so don't need to iterate through whole list to add new node)
- add every new structure to tail.next
