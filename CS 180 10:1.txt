extent: how long a value is maintained/its "lifetime"
- for local var: same as scope
- parameters: created on method call, destroyed on return
- objects: created by new, destroyed when garbage is collected (by reference counting)

Method signature: method name & parameter types
- method names don't need to be unique as long as parameter types are different
