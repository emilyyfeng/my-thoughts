ANTIQUITY
Euripides: 
- betrayed foreign wife
- surgical rhetoric
- children killed
- deus ex machina escape in Helios' dragon chariot
- baseline for all later arguments

Ovid:
- wrote a letter to Jason from the POV of Medea
- Medea's interior voice becomes a later model for first-person
- sympathetic to Medea

Seneca:
- Darkens tone
- amplifies witchcraft and rage
- positions Medea as anti-Stoic case study


EARLY CHRISTIAN FRAMING
- Medea becomes a warning label for pagan spectacle
	- Tertullian belived: theater = idolatry + moral contamination; tragic crimes (like Medea's) defile an audience
	- "The things you see, you also commit"
	- interpretive move: for once, don't allegorize, but avoid Medea as a form of media


MIDDLE AGES (Pt I)
2 vernacular tales (Tuscan & Venetian)
- Jason abandons a pregnant Medea on an island; she births twins, survives on roots, later kills the boys, cooks their hearts, and serves them to Jason
- Venetian variant adds children's bodies nailed to his door; Medea then kills herself

- gore escalates, mobility erased
- no dragon chariot
- one of the few receptions where Medea pays with her life
- Medieval exemplum logic: heighten both atrocity and pathos to warn/teach

MIDDLE AGES (Pt II)
"Book of the City of Ladies" by Christine de Pizan:
- response to a widespread medieval tradition that portrayed women as weak, irrational, lascivious, and morally defective
- Medea "surpassed all women" in learning and herbs; sorcery = "scientia"
- portrays Medea as the helper-maiden who saves Jason out of love and compassion
- murders committed, focus on betrayal

- CHaucer and Gower likewise stress Jason's treachery, downplays violence


RENAISSANCE
Founding of the "Order of the Golden Fleece' by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy
- wrote manuscripts flaunting Medea's worst: skull-bleeding, brother's dismemberment, dragons wrecking a wedding
- political aim to exonerate Jason and elevate their brand


19TH CENTURY
Trilogy written under Metternich's censorship and the trauma of post-Napoleonic Vienna
Book 1: Fleece is not a prize but a curse (will grant political power but only based on fear) — Colchis is an authoritarian state
Book 2: Jason and Medea are blinded by idealism
Book 3: Greece rejects Medea, public humiliation, children prefer the Greek princess, Jason recoils from a "barbarian" wife
- myth veils critiques of dangerous rulers (Aeetes), failed idealists (Jason), and displaced people (Medea)


ART-FILM
Pasolini's "Medea" (1969)
- Medea symbolizes the enchanted world the west has lost
- ritualized, world-culture imagery: archaic East vs. rational/disenchanted West
- myth vs. modernity
- Colonial logic
- feminine knowledge


FEMINIST REWRITES
Mariela Boggio: "Italian Medea" (1981)
- Medea not a sorceress, not a mythic barbarian, not psychotic
- structurally entrapped: abandonment by a feckless Jason-figure, lack of legal and social protection, the Catholic ideal of a "good mother" which she cannot inhabit

Toni Morrison: "Beloved" (1987)
- based on slave Margaret Garner, who took the life of her child so they wouldn't grow up in slavery (referred in anti-abolitionist newspapers as the modern Medea)
- "I took and put my babies where they'd be safe"
