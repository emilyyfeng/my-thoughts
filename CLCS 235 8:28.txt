AETIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS: provide an explanation for names and origins of hundreds of local deities, e.g. "aphros" that Aphrodite was born from is why she's named that, or "chronos" (meaning time) for Kronos

- Greeks worshipped sacred rocks because Rhea disguised baby Zeus as a rock, so rocks could represent "gods"

THEOGONY was created for:
- systematizing (organizing myths into one cohesive story, creates idea of Greek pantheon)
- justifying (providing a divine charter for he political & ritual order of the world)
- exploring (investigating nature of power, justice, violence, and order through the metaphor of divine family drama)

Myths serve as containers into which a society... stores it values and grapples with issues fundamental to life.

EUHERMERIST/RATIONALIST APPROACH: idea that myth is just distorted history, where gods/heroes were originally great humans from the past, whose deeds were exaggerated in storytelling until they were worshipped as deities.
