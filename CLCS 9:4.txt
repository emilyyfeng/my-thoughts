amor omnia vincit (love conquers all)  — all beings are subject to the forces of love
loveblindness

most greek goddesses were virginized or matronized — except Aphrodite

in Hymn to Aphrodite, Zeus (male) curbs Aphrodite's (female) power
- also hint of older tradition of A bring mistress of animals (potnia theron)
- Aition ("cause", origin tale) for the cult of Aeneas' family

DEMETER:
demeter: goddess of life and growth, also bound to death and decay
persephone: victim and queen
both more feared than hades
- chthonic deities ("from the earth")

Hymn to Demeter:
- exploration of maternal grief (lost daughter to death and/or marriage)
- encounters of Demophoon and Iambe

- patriarchal power trumps maternal power
- female power is passive (withholding crops) while male power is active (seizing)

- twofold aetiology (explains seasons, explains Eleusian Mysteries — secret cult purported to secure a more favorable afterlife involving pomegranate seed, kykeon, Demophoon's fire, alluding to secret rituals)
