BACKTRACKING: another use of recursion — problem solving by trial and error
Problem must be decomposable into series of steps
- try step
- if successful — progress step (recursive)
- if failure — backtrack (undo step)
Each recursive instance "remembers" what step was taken and how to undo it if things don't work out
