323–31 BCE
The Greek theatrical profession becomes Panhellenic
- Playwrights, actors, and musicians were organized into associations: "oi peri ton Dionysion technitari" ("the artists in the service of Dionysus")
- performed a repertoire of classics: tragedy (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides), comedy (most famous playwright Menander)

Roman tragedy:
- 264–202 BC: Punic Wars
- 168 BC: Battle of Pydna (final Roman conquest of Greece)
- 44 BC: death of Julius Caesar
- 31 BC: battle of Actium, end of the civil wars, beginning of Roman empire

Lucius Livius Andronicus: a Greek slave, worked as grammaticus ("professor of Greek and Latin"), "inventor" of Roman Drama
- translated the Odyssey into Latin and produced the first Latin translations of Greek plays

Tragedy: fabula cothurnata or crepidaia ("Play in corthurni ['go-go boots'] or sandals)
- professionalized troupes, not civic choruses
- star actors
- spectacle and music emphasized
- stock scenic conventions — painted backdrops, deus ex machina, and a smaller chorus (sometimes replaced by a single attendant figure)
- emphasized virtus, pietas, and fatum, rather than divine caprice or heroic irony 
	- rhetorical monologues and declamatory speeches
	- gods become more distant, moral responsibility shifted to human will and civic duty

ROMAN ATTITUDES TO PERFORMERS
- actors were socially stigmatized and legally marginalized as infames ("disreputable/infamous")
- banned from the army and disenfranchised; liable to be flogged by Roman magistrates anywhere; forbidden to marry free-born citizens

BEFORE SENECA: MEDEA'S LITERACY APPEARANCES
- Apollonius: love-struck helper maiden, Jason kills Apsyrtus
- Euripides: betrayed wife, infanticide is calculated revenge, chorus often sympathetic
- Ovid: psychological volatility (& bigger magic)
- Seneca: opens on pure furor; magic as theatrical engine
	- hostile chorus: civic conventionality, not sympathy
	- aphoristic
	- onstage violence
	- spectable

SENECA'S MEDEA:
Opening image:
- Medea starts with marriage gods, then pivots to praying to Chaos and the dead
- Wants to curse Jason, not with death, but with poverty and suffering
- reframes their marriage as scelus from the start (family born from crime must suffer from more crime)
- hard cut to chorus singing happy wedding song for Jason and Creusa
- Medea hears the wedding music, starts long list of all the things she did for him

Nurse: stoic equanimity ("hidden anger hurts") vs. Medea: stoic self-sufficiency ("fortune can take my wealth away, but not my spirit")

Creon: political power (wants her to bend to power, whether it is just or not) vs. Medea: personal power (she has her own personal power), appeals as a mother ("let me kiss my children one last time... What fear of plots in such brief span of time?")

Choral ode:
- ode about how seafaring is hubris, it invites new dangers (like Medea)
