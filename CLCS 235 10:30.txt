ENTER MADNESS: LYSSA AND IRIS
- Reverse deus ex machina
- Hera sends Lyssa (goddess of madness, daughter of Ouranos and Nyx), Lyssa hesitates due to Heracles' goodness
- Iris (messenger goddess) urges Hera's bidding

THE KILLING
- Heracles is purifying himself after killing Lycus when Lyssa strikes (irony)
- uses his bow to kill his family
- kills kids first, then Megara (opposite order of Megara's request to Lycus, didn't want to see her children die)
- Heracles tries to kill Amphitryon, Athena ties him to a pillar, he is so enraged he destroys his house

THE EKKYKLEMA (wouldn't show people dying on stage, would roll out bodies)
- Heracles is bound amid the bodies, a column broken beside him
- House and household (oikos) in ruins
- Mirror image of the opening tableau (Megara and kids around altar vs. their bodies around Heracles)

- Heracles wakes up, is confused
- Amphitryon tries to softly lie, Heracles resolves to die
- Amphitryon blames the gods — his hope at the beginning is now a total absence of hope

ENTER THESEUS
- wants to repay debt to Heracles, offers asylum to Heracles, tries to get Heracles to not blame the gods
- Heracles accepts asylum, but refuses to forgive the gods
	- moral argument: if gods do these things/behave like humans, then they are not gods
- disowns Zeus in favor of mortal lineage Amphitryon

PLAY OF MIRRORING
- protector becomes destroyer
- altar becomes ruins
- bow goes form defense to atrocity
- Amphitryon frames both ends (starts with hope, ends with despair and loss)


RECEPTION
Hellenistic/Eastern:
- artists borrow Heracles' body to image Buddha's guardian

Late Antiquity:
- deflating the hero: he never conquered anger; gladiators kill more beasts
- tactical appropriation — Heracles' katabasis (the myth where he goes into the underworld and returns) foreshadows Christ's victory over death

Middle Ages:
- Heracles Christ-like (Vir Perfectus "Perfect man")
- Monarchs and liberators identify with Heracles

Modernity:
- French Revolution: Hercules flips from monarchic emblem to the People of the French Revolution (had to do labors under King Eurystheus)
- Agatha Christie: character Poirot calls him "a large muscular creature of low intelligence"
- Durrenmatt: Hercules and the Augean Stables, takes a long time because of bureaucracy
