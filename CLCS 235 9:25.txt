Interpretations of Oedipus myth throughout history:

MEDIEVAL PERIOD
Emphasizes:
- focus on the war
- Latin/Roman version
- knights and chivalry
- begins trend of treating Jocasta sympathetically
- lesson in humility before God's inscrutable will
- St. Gregory (similar incest situation to Oedipus) considered good (performed extreme penance and becomes a saint), Oedipus considered bad

De-emphasizes:
- incest & patricide
- Greek origins


RESTORATION ENGLAND
Emphasizes:
- subplot of (royal advisor) Creon plotting for the throne (Richard III)
- warns against tyrants and over-mighty courtiers — relating to Exclusion Crisis 1679
- more spectacle
- mapping the take onto familiar Shakespearian political drama
- political allegory for civil upheaval

De-emphasizes:
- Greek origins
- mythological elements


ENLIGHTENMENT
Emphasizes:
- Greek version by Sophocles
- maintains political intrigue (Creon scheming for power)
- rationalization — why not investigate Laius' murder earlier?

De-emphasizes:
- softens/downplays role of fate
- tones down incest (nobleman Philoctete in love with Jocasta)


ROMANTIC/19th CENTURY
Emphasizes:
- treats myth as parody of the scandal of King George IV & Queen Caroline of England
- corruption, oppression, gluttony
- deeper meaning than lessons about kingship. more abstract like natural cycles

De-emphasizes:
- fate and incest
- kingly position of Oedipus, becomes an everyman
- mythological/magic elements — treating them scientifically as nature allegories: the sun (Oedipus) "killing" the darkness (Laius) and uniting with the earth (Jocasta as mother earth)


EARLY 20th CENTURY
Emphasizes:
- Freud: Oedipus mirrors a universal infantile unconscious urge of a son to kill his father and possess his mother
- inner development of Oedipus: moral freedom he achieves after blinding himself
- argues individual will and self-knowledge can transcend fate
- characters drawn by invisible threats representing psychological impulses
- Sphinx falling in love with Oedipus

De-emphasizes:
- kingly position of Oedipus, becomes an everyman
- fate, but about desire
- message of moral luck, more about self-actualization
- psychological impulse instead of fate


MODERN RETELLINGS
Emphasizes:
- taking personal responsibility

De-emphasizes:
- fatalistically blaming gods/destiny
