Reception of Orpheus & Eurydice myth often tweaks one module to get a new meaning:
1. Superhuman art (music as force)
2. Katabasis (downward journey)
3. Conditional rescue (a rule)
4. The glance (taboo + doubt)
5. The aftermath (loss, dismemberment, legacy)


LATE ANTIQUITY: CHURCH POLITICS
2 vastly different (almost opposite) interpretations, either:
1. Orpheus as dangerous pagan seducer
- The backward glance becomes a blank slot for moral teaching (weak morals, lack of faith)
- Clement of Alexandria: a "charlatan" (goes"0 using "cunning sorcery)

2. Orpheus as Christ=like — descent to the dead + shepherd imagery
- Orpheus-as-shepherd imagery
- Some Orpheus mosaics were so Christ=like they were misidentified as "The Good Shepherd"
- idea of Orphism rituals leading to better afterlife, similar to Christian heaven


MIDDLE AGES
- Characters become abstract tokens
- the story survives by being useful, not "true"

Boethius: Orpheus as the Soul on the Upward Path
- Orpheus = striving mind
- Eurydice = (negative) earthly attachment
- looking back = spiritual relapse

Sir Orfeo (13–14th c.): poem makes Orpheus an allegory for good/bad king
- myth turns courtly and Celtic
- Orpheus becomes a king with a harp
- Eurydice becomes a queen abducted by the Fairy King (popular damsel-in-distress narrative)
- Biggest change: no backward glance => happy ending, Orpheus becomes more enlightened king


RENAISSANCE
- truth relocates from metaphysics => psychology of Orpheus' myth
- Orpheus stops being only symbolic and becomes "character" again
- Orpheus = artistic sensitivity, erotic yearning, psychological fracture, tension between imagination and loss

Poliziano's "Favola d'Orfeo" (1480)
- secular myth telling
- court performance culture (keeps Ovid's speech)
- myth as erotic tragedy (talks about Orpheus' turn to male lovers after losing Eurydice)
- ancestor to Monteverdi's L'Orfeo opera


ENLIGHTENMENT
- Orpheus = proof music can "soften" human nature
- the myth becomes a claim about what art does to people (art as social technology)

Francis Bacon, "Wisdom of the Ancients"
- Music softens barbarous people
- uses Orpheus to praise Ovid's portion of Orpheus ditching women for younger male lovers as a productivity hack: "The philosopher or statesman who engages too deeply with women, sensual love, or domestic attachments loses sight of higher intellectual labor."


OPERA INTERPRETATIONS
- classical tragedy becomes courtly consolation (uses deus ex machina to make rich audience leave the opera happy)
- Monteverdi's L'Orfeo: Apollo swoops in and lifts Orpheus to the heavens
- Rossi's Orfeo: Cupid saves the day
- Later adaptations: muses, shepherds, allegorical Reason itself intervenes


MODERNISM
Offenbach's 1858 "Orphee aux Enfers":
- Orpheus (high profile, violent teacher) in abusive relationship with Eurydice
- "Public Opinion" forces them to get back together
- The underworld reimagined as Parisian Libertine nightlife (filled with bored gods who want entertainment)
- claims myth survives only because society idealizes marriage as sacred and virtuous
