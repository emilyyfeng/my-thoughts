ACT III
The Nurse prepares the entrance of Medea and Jason (Medea is angry)
- Jason: political necessity — Creon is ordering Jason to marry instead of Jason's choice, frames his actions as protection for Medea and children
- Medea: Jason used her for his personal gain — "They are yours, yours! If you gain from a crime, you did it."

Medea feigns a desire for exile with her children
- Jason: doesn't want Medea to take their children away — says "They are my reason for living... I would rather lose my breath, my body, or the light"
- Medea: has an aside "Good! I have him trapped: there is a place to hurt him" — knowing his love for their children becomes her leverage

3rd choral ode: Curse of the Fleece (lists deaths of the Argonauts), describes the anger of a rejected wife is a force more terrible than any natural disaster

ACT IV
"New Wedding"
- Neronian excess
- Nurse's ekphrsis (verbal description of what the audience sees of Medea's workshop)
- elaborate incantation and ritual done on stage
- does not show marriage and death 

4th choral ode: describes Medea as blood-stained Maenad and a tigress in the groves of the Ganges who has lost her cubs — very "other"-ing descriptions, references to the east

ACT V
Psychomachia: a battle for Medea's soul
- she's their mother, but not their mother
- they are her children, but also not
- they need to die because they are not hers, or they need to die because they are hers

- Medea kills one son off stage, kills the other one in front of Jason (and implicitly, the audience)
- Jason's ending line: "... prove that there are no gods wherever you go."

SENECA'S VERSION
Cautionary tale: Medea's wrath (ira) and grief (dolor) drive her to atrocity, illustrating the Stoic notion that ungoverned emotions are akin to madness

STRUCTURALIST INTERPRETATION
Structuralists think that myths work like language; language functions through binaries
- Mother/not mother, chair/not chair
- more complex: life/death, nature/culture, chaos/order, mortal/divine, insider/outsider

Myth explores these binaries by blurring the gap between them
- Function: helps a society to safely probe, maintain, rebalance these binaries and better process how and when these binaries come into tension

What binaries (x/not x) come into conflict/become blurry in the Medea myth?
- mother/not mother
- Medea's children/not Medea's children
- justification/not justified
- mortal/divine (Medea is on the boundary of mortal and divine)
- insider/outsider
- love/hate (does Medea love or hate Jason)
- rationality/irrationality (makes rational arguments for irrational behaviors)
