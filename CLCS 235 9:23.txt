Concept of: zoe ("bare life") vs. bios ("livelihood; qualified life") — the polis is what turns zoe into bios
- very political, whose life is protected as bios and whose is abandoned to zoe
- play sends message about refugees and how they are/should be treated

Polynices wants blessing, Oedipus accuses him of filial neglect, opportunism. Oedipus curses his sons to die at the hands of each other. Polynices requests Antigone to bury him properly when he dies.

Concept of second sight: Oedipus is blind but he sees far better than before/sees people for who they are
- sees through Creon
- sees the good in Theseus
- sees the doomed nature of his son's plight
- sees the shape of his own afterlife as a heroic protector

Moral message? End of OR, Oedipus sees himself as guilty. End of OC, he sees himself not only as innocent but even sacred.
- suffering gives you some inestimable value, some deeper depth/knowledge that people who haven't suffered can never possess
- Oedipus progressed from a clever person who can solve riddles => someone who has deeper wisdom

Oedipus' body assumes an inestimable value throughout the play: considered useless, not beautiful to look at — yet in death, it has a great value
- almost like Sophocles creates the worst possible supplicant, but makes him divine
- Oedipus is not just zoe, but there is a power in helping the unempowered, meek, abject

Hero cults:
- widespread in Attica

3 INTERPRETATIONS OF SOPHOCLES' PLAYS:
1) Pietists
- Sophocles aims to present an optimistic universe, his larger-than life heroes lack moderation and consequently incur tragic disaster
2) Impietists
- Sophoclean heroes are real heroes, the fault lies with the gods' jealousy or hostility. celebrates heroic humanism
3) Aestheticists
- rejection of didactic/moralizing readings and emphasis on the emotional power of Sophoclean drama

OMNI-LOCAL:
- a defining characteristic of myths — lending themselves to being localized/personalized
- aka any culture in any age can adopt the Oedipus myth by moulding it into their own social framework, spicing it with their own cultural flavors
