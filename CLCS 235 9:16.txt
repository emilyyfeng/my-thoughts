Why bad things are happening to Thebes:
- Laius (Oedipus' father) is hosted by (Tantalus' son) Pelops, but seduces and abducts Pelops' son Chrysippus (breach of xenia) => curses his family

- the oracle tells laius "do not beget a son" or the son will kill you
- he pierces Oedipus' ankles, gives him to an herdsman to "expose" (aka leave out in the wild to die)
- Oedipus found and adopted by Corinthian shepherds, named Oedipus "swollen foot"
- where Oedipus killed Laius was at a crossroads between Thebes and somewhere else, chose Thebes and met and killed father (crossroads: "triodos" latin is "trivia") near Daulia in Phocis
- Sphinx means "throttler", face of woman. lion's body, bird's wings; apex female predator in myth — sent by Hera to punish Laius, perches on Mount Phicium and poses a riddle
- riddle: "what has one voice and is four footed, two footed, and three footed?" — man
- Creon promised throne and Laius' widow to solver of riddle 
- Oedipus marries Jocasta, rules Thebes

- plague pushes Oedipus to hunt Laius' killer
- Tiresias, blind seer (paradox — one who can see is one who is blind)
- Recognition (anagnorisis): Corinthian messenger, Theban herdsman confirms, the feet scars
- Reversal (peripeteia): Jocasta hangs herself, Oedipus blinds himself, is driven out of Thebes as considered source of pollution (miasma)

THEMES:
- fate vs free will
- knowledge vs ignorance / sight vs blindness
- arrogance vs confidence
- Oedipus vs Tiresias

VARIANTS:
- Oedipus + Jocasta => Eteocles, Polynices, Antigone, Ismene
- Another ancient line aus the mother of his children was Euryganeia
- In Odyssey Jocaste is Epicaste, Oedipus keeps ruling
- Euripedes' Phoenissae: Jocasta lives longer and dies in son's war

AFTERMATH
Alternating rule pact fails (Eteocles rules 1 year, Polynices rules 1 year, repeat)
- Polynices gets kicked out, goes to Argos, marries in family of Adrastus
- they seige against Themes
- Polyices and Eteocles kill each other, Creon takes over
- "Cadmean victory" = win that ruins the winner (referring to seige against Thebes, Cadmeus founded Thebes)

RITUALISTS
Emile Durkheim
- rituals express and reinforce collective bonds, especially contracts and obligations within a community
- beliefs alone don't bind people; ritual acts do
- ritual makes the invisible contract visible, credible and binding
- myth often arose as a narrative to explain or legitimate the ritual

Jane Ellen Harrison:
- myth is the "the spoken corollary" of a ritual
