HERACLES VS. ORPHEUS — what makes a hero?
Heracles: 
- dominates nature by force
- kills music teacher Linos with lyre when hit for bad playing (opposed to "soft power" of arts)

Orpheus:
- dominates nature through song
- birds, animals, trees, even rivers respond to his music

Shared features: violent death at the hands of women, descent to the Underworld


ORPHEUS' ORIGINS
Mother: the Muse Calliope (epic poetry)
Father: Either Oeagrus (Thracian king, priest of Dionysus) or Apollo (god of music & prophecy)
- Thracian identity: from the "wild" northern frontier of Thrace, source of magic and danger in Greek imagination
- Orphism: cult led by Thracian priests, certain rituals and directions in Underworld would led you to Isle of Blessed

Orpheus as "in-between":
- civilized Greek art + barbarian wildness
- mortal + quasi-divine parentage
This liminal status prepares him to cross the boundary between life and death (e.g. Hermes)


ORPHEUS' POWER OF MUSIC
- tames beasts, trees uproot themselves to draw near
- rivers change course to hear him

On Jason's voyage:
- calms feuding Argonauts by singing the origins of the cosmos
- outplays the sirens vs. Odysseus survives the Sirens by blocking their song (wax for other sailors' ears, tied himself with ropes to the mast)


ORPHEUS IN ROMAN ROMSAICS
Common across the Roman Empire, shows up in villas from Britain to North Africa, depicts:
- Orpheus seated with lyre/cithara
- wearing a Phrygian cap (exotic, "Eastern")
- surrounded by pacified animals (including fox, es, lions, exotic beasts)
- Roman Imperial self-image: civilization harmonizing the "barbarian" world


ENTER EURYDICE
Orpheus marries Eurydice, a wood nymph (dryad) — marriage is intensely loving (aka immediately doomed in Greek myth standards)
- two key Latin sources: Virgil and Ovid — same plot, very different moral universes


VIRGL VS OVID
Virgil (70–19 BCE)
- rural background, close to Maecenas: becomes the regime's semi-official vates
- Orpheus appears in Georgics 4 inside the story of Aristaeus' dead hive: a tragic inset tale in a poem about labor, ritual, and rural restoration

Ovid (43 BCE–17/18 CE)
- wealthy equestrian from Italy, erotic and playful, later exiled to Tomis
- Orpheus opens Metamorphoses 10 and then becomes an internal narrator of love tragedies before his death in Book 11


EURYDICE'S DEATH
Virgi, Georgics 4:
- Aristaeus persues Eurydice, attempting rape => she flees headlong along a river bank, steps on a venomous snake and dies => Aristaeus' bees are killed in punishment
- ecological theology: violence against a nymph (nature) disrupts the whole system until ritual sacrifice restores it (Aristaeus sacrifices his prize bull)

Ovid, Metamorphoses 10:
- wedding: Hymen's (god of marriages) torches are snuffed out instead of lit (bad omen)
- Eurydice, dancing with Naiads, is bitten on the ankle by a viper
- no culprit; pure accident => emphases on randomness and unfairness of loss


DESCENT TO UNDERWORLD: Art against law
Refusing to accept Eurydice's death, Orpheus descends via a cave-entrance into Hades
Music functions as the passport:
- charms Charon into ferrying a living man
- soothes Cerberus at the gate with music

Before Hades and Persephone, he pleads to "borrow" her (in both versions), reasoning to Hades that she belongs to death anyway


BARGAIN & BACKWARD GLANCE
- Eurydice may return if Orpheus walks ahead and does not look back until both are in the upper world
- folkloric trap, but also about trust vs. doubt; respect for the unseen vs. demand for visible proof

Virgil's diagnosis of backward glance:
- "sudden madness" seizes the incautus amans ("careless lover")
- When Eurydice is sent back, asks "what great madness (furor) has destroyed us?"

Ovid's psychology:
- Orpheus turns back "fearing she might fail, and eager to see her"
- no cosmic rebuke, just the rule enforced when he breaks it

In both versions, Orpheus sees her for split second before she dissolves into a shade, whispering vale ("farewell")


PLATO'S HOSTILE TAKE
In plato's Symposium (Phaedrus' speech):
- love can make people virtuous: positive example: Alcestis, who dies for her husband, is the model lover vs. negative example: Orpheus, who schemes to enter Hades alive, is cowardly


AFTERMATH
After losing Eurydice twice:
- Orpheus tries to re-enter Hades; Charon/Hades refuses
- Long period of mourning and isolation in Thrace

In Ovid:
- Orpheus rejects all women, turns to male lovers and becomes narrator of a cycle of doomed love stores (Hyacinthus, Myrrha, Adonis, etc.)
- his trauma becomes a new poetic program
- has crisis of faith in Orphism (1st version: gives up allegiance to Dionysus and starts worshipping Apollo, 2nd version: sees his Orphism followers in Hades but not in Isle of Blessed, realizes Orphism was a trick and swears off religion, starts worshipping Apollo/Helios as symbol of need for steady order like the sun)

Death by Maenads:
- angered by his rejection of women (and in some traditions, his preference for Apollo over Dionysus)
- at first, his music makes their missiles fall harmlessly
- they drown out his song with shrieks, drums, and noise
- then tears him limb from limb (sparagmos)

Muses bury limbs at foot of Mount Olympus, Orpheus' floating head drifts down the Hebrus to Lesbos, still singing and prophesying
- Enshrined as an oracle that eventually is silenced by Apollo (destroys temple with head)
