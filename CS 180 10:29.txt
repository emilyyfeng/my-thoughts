GUI: GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
- user interacts using keyboard and pointing device
- program responds to user events with actions
- easier to hide functionality (sometimes detrimentally so)

Windowing system
- software that manages the screen
	- usually supports WIMP (windows, icons, menus, and pointer)
- implements graphical primitives
- abstracts graphics hardware
- handles input devices
- some support remote access

- java.awt and javax.swing have classes that help construct GUIS
- Java GUI components adopt "lock and feel" of local systems (sometimes not well)

showInputDialog
- obtain user input
- returns a string
