HERACLES

Childhood:
- Alcmene (descendant of Perseus & Io), Amphitryon, and Zeus's affair (pretended to be Amphitryon) — Alcmene doubly impregnated with a child of Zeus & a child of Amphitryon

Madness of Heracles:
- Hera sends goddess of madness
- Heracles kills Megara and their children

- Heracles needs to atone for the miasma of killing his family; goes to Eurystheus (Heracles' cousin), mightly (but sickly) king of Mycene, for advice => demands 12 Labors


12 Labors:

- Heracles redirects Alpheus river to clean stables
- Eurystheus doesn't count it as Heracles got compensation

6. Symphalian birds

In the meantime...
- King Admetus (son of Apollo) was supposed to die before his time
- Apollo gets fates to exchange Admetus' fate with someone else
- Apollo asks around, no one agrees (including Admetus' parents)
- Alcestis (Admetus' wife) agrees and dies
- Heracles shows up, has feast with Admetus but Admetus doesn't want to talk about Alcestis
- servant tells Heracles
- Heracles hides near Alcestis' recent burial site, Thanatos comes to pick her up — Heracles wrestles Thanatos and wins (in exchange for Alcestis' revival, she's not allowed to speak for 3 days)

8. Mares of Diomedes (Thracian king — NOT Iliad Diomedes)
- man-eating horses
- Heracles brings new lover Abderos, horses eat him
- Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses (horses stop craving human flesh after eating master)

9. Hippolyta's belt
- Amazons in Black Sea region, Queen Hippolyta's famous golden girdle, she gives it to Heracles peacefully but Hera tricks him into thinking it was a trick; starts war

11. Apples of the Hesperides
- apples given to Hera as a gift, protected by dragon and Hesperides
