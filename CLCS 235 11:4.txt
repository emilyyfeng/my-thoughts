MEDEA: none Greek, non-normative
- Granddaughter of Helios, daughter of Aeëtes (King of Aia/Colchis on the Black Sea's eastern shore0
- Kin to Circe (aunt) — sorcery runs in the family
- student of Hecate, studied pharmaka (poisons and potions from roots); Prometheus' ichor spills onto earth, grows Prometheus plant, Medea makes potions out of these plants
- epithet: polypharmakos (person of many pharmaka)


ENTER JASON
The Golden Fleece Problem
- Jason's father Pelias receives oracle that his son will kill him (the son that is only wearing 1 sandal)
- Jason's mother sends him away from Iolcus (town in Thessaly that Pelias is king of)
- on Jason's journey back to Iolcus, sees old woman (Hera in disguise) in river and carries her across, losing 1 sandal — Hera decides to be his patron goddess
- Pelias wants to get rid of Jason — sends him to get Golden Fleece (considered suicide mission)

Argo (magical thinking, speaking ship), Argonauts: Orpheus, Heracles, Lynceus (can see anything — very far and through ground), Castor and Pollux, Peleus (father of Achilles), Telamon (father of Ajax), Laertes (father of Odysseus), Zetes and Calais (sons of north wind Boreas), Admetus (husband of Alcestis), Meleager (brother of Deianeira), and more
- many obstacles, e.g.: 
- had to find Phineus (old blind seer) plagued by harpies who steal/ruin his food before he can eat for angering a god
- Zetes & Calais chase away/kill harpies, get directions for journey from Phineus

- Aphrodite teaches Jason love magic using an iunx (spinning noise maker using strings)


JASON'S ARRIVAL AT COLCHIS
Aeetes' quid pro quo:
- Golden Fleece in exchange for Jason yoking fire-breathing bulls, sowing dragons's teeth, defeating earth-born warriors that spring out of the teeth, then get past the sleepless serpent, in 1 day
- Jason makes Medea fall in love with him, promises to marry and take her away in exchange for her help (oath to gods)
- Medea makes "Drug of Prometheus" — makes Jason invulnerable for a day (involves ointment and ritual sacrifice)
- they steal the Fleece from never-sleeping snake (Medea uses magic to make it fall asleep) and flee
- Aeetes
- Death of Medea's baby brother, 2 variants:
1) Medea lures Apsyrtos (older in this version) to a parley, Jason ambush-kills him
2) Medea kills (baby) brother and dismembers him, throws him into the sea — slows Aeetes down by forcing him to pick up body parts to give him a proper burial


MEETING CIRCE
- Kinslaying stains Medea & Jason (miasma) — purifies them
- rejects Medea (can't stay with Aunt Circe)

- Sirens (Orpheus plays louder)
- Scylla and Charybdis (escapes because Helios makes deal with Myriads to help his granddaughter)
- Phaeacians (people devoted to Poseidon, Odysseus also encounters them) — host marriage for Medea and Jason
- stuck in Libya, Jason has dream of how to escape
- arrive in Crete, encounters giant metal man Talos who throws boulders at ships, Medea uses magic to defeat him


BACK IN IOLCUS
- Pelias asks for a few more years as King — Jason gets depressed, Medea takes action
- Medea and Pelias' daughters hang out, Medea tricks them (shows them chopping up a ram, throws into boiling cauldron, and out emerges a young lamb), gives them all the ingredients except 1
- daughters chop up Pelias but fail to revive him
- Jason and Medea exiled


ARRIVAL IN CORINTH
- Jason ingratiates himself with Creon (different one than Megara's father), offers daughter Glauce
- Jason accepts
- Medea gives diadem and dress to Glauce as wedding gift, Glauce puts on dress and combusts, so does Creon for trying to take dress off her
- original myth: Medea exiled, Corinthians kill Medea's children
- Euripidean twist: Medea baths and kills children before the Corinthians can, Jason sees Medea in flying Chariot of Helios  with dead children at feet, Medea refuses to give them to Jason, goes to bury them at sanctuary of Hera


AFTER CORINTH
- Medea goes to Athens, marries Aegeus (father of Theseus)
- Bears Medos (origin of Persians)
- Plots against Theseus (wants Medos to be king), Medea gets caught and exiled, goes back to Colchis
- Kills her father's usurper Perses and restores Aeetes to Colchis throne
- some say she marries Achilles in the Isles of the Blessed


JASON'S END
- returns to Iolcus after Glauce's death
- Finds the Argo rotting away on land, sits next to it for shade
- prow falls off, hits Jason and kills him


PSYCHOANALYTIC
Myths as the dreams of society: to help us safely process subconscious desires/fears
- The Oedipus complex: desire for the opposite=sex parent; rivalry with the same-sex parent
- Sibling rivalry, repressed aggression, guilt, etc.

Dreams => personal unconscious
Myths => collective unconscious of a culture

How to apply the approach:
1) Identify hidden tensions — look for conflicts between desire and duty, or love and fear, and the like
2) Read symbolically
3) is there a resolution/failure of resolution?
