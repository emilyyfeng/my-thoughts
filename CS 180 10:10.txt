EXCEPTIONS
Definition: an event that occurs during execution that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions

- explicit checking with if-then-else
	- return values used to signal an error
	- used in C, often -1
	- what if your function returns negative numbers - how to distinguish?
- java has built-in exception handling mechanism
	- exceptional cases can leverage a special type of control flow

Sequence:
- Java stops execution of the current method
- java creates an exception object
	- contains info about the error: type, program state, etc
- hands exception object in the runtime system called throwing
- runtime system searches call stack for na exception handler to deal with the problem
 once found, displayed

STACKS
Last in first out LIFO data structure
- push() : push something on stack
- pop() : retrieve most recently push()-ed item

Catching: first exception handler than can handle the exception object type is used, if none found, program terminates

- exceptions are objects
- an exception object is an instance of:
	- class Exception
	- or a subclass of Exception
- created using new
- 2 useful methods:
	- printMessage()
	- getStackTrace()

CATCH OR SPECIFY:
- code that might throw an exception must either
	- be enclosed in a try statement that catches the exception
	- exist within a method that specifies it can through the exception (method must provide a throw clause for the exception)

KINDS OF EXCEPTIONS:
Checked:
- subject to catch or specify requirement
- every exception except Error and RuntimeException

Unechecked:
- not subject to catch or specify
- error (conditions external to the application that cannot be recovered from e.g hardware)

- a method can declare that it throws an exception... "throws" is a keyword

finally block
- want to make sure something is done even when an exception is thrown
- gets executed even if there's a return
- System.exit() will stop the finally from executing

"If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception." If not â€“ unchecked
