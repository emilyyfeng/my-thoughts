Narrowing — reverse
double to float, etc.
- can lose information
- often not permitted without a cast 

CASTING: converts at runtime a value of one numeric type to a similar value of another numeric type — EXCEPT bool, also checks at runtime that a reference value refers to an object of compatible class, e.g.

	double d = 3.21;
	float f = (float) d;

Upcasting — type promotion/widening (permitted and can happen automatically)

AUTOBOXING: 
- primitive types have corresponding "object wrapper" classes, e.g. int -> Integer, double -> Double, etc.
Character myChar = 'a';
- conversion other way is called unboxing

REFERENCE TYPES
- declarations create space for reference to an object, not the object itself
- must use 'new' to construct the object

STRINGS
- built-in class, no need to import
- literals are objects ("hello")
- string variables hold references to objects
- concatenation:
	- string1.concat(string2)
	- or string1 + string2
