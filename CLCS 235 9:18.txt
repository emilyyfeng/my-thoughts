Aristotle on Tragedy: Tragedy is the representation (mimesis) of a series (spoudeia) and complete (teleia) action (praxis), having a certain size, with embellished language used distinctly in the various parts of the play, the representation being accomplished by people performing and not by narration (diegesis), and through pity (eleos) and fear (phobos) achieving the purification (katharsis) of such emotions.

Sophoclean Irony:	
Oedipus Tyrannus:
- the most gifted of mortals in intelligence doesn't even know who his parents are
- the man who saved Thebes brought pollution to Thebes
- blind Teiresias is the only one who sees
- When oedipus 'sees', he blinds himself

Sophoclean hero:
- lonely characters, set apart from the rest of the world
- stubborn to a fault
- usually a "foil" to the hero, e.g. Neoptolemus to Philoctetes, Odysseus to Ajax, Ismene to Antigone, Theseus to Oedipus)
- spectacular use of objects as powerful visual symbols, e.g. sword of Ajax, bow of Heracles, Electra's empty urn, Deianeira's robe, Oedipus' stone seat

OC:
- a story about tolerance (celebrates virtues of kindness, tolerance, and mutual assistance)
- a celebration of Athens (depicted as an ideal community — humane, charitable to strangers, resourceful, favored by the gods)
- Thebes = expediency/caring about politics above all, considered the anti-Athens
